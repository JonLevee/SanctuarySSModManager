Mod manager for Sanctuary: Shattered Sun

**This document is a work in progress**

## Background

[Sanctuary: Shattered Sun](https://www.sanctuaryshatteredsun.com/) is a new RTS that is being developed by Enhearten Media.  
This appears to be the long-awaited sequel to the Total Annhilation/Supreme Commander/Supreme Commander 2/Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance series.

The game is currently in development and isn't expected out until 2025.

The game has been built specifically to support extensive modding, which is done by modifying the script files that will ship with the product.

## Overview
This project is designed to be a simple modding manager (similar to [SC2MM-170710-RC2](https://www.moddb.com/mods/revamp-mod/downloads/sc2-mod-manager-release-071017-rc2))

It will allow the user to perform the follow actions:


- mod management
	- creation
	- editing
	- packaging
	- publishing
- play management
	- mod installation
	- mod activation
	- mod renewal
	- game launch


## Tasks
- [ ] Where do we publish/retrieve from?  
- [ ] figure out if we can support patching (much smaller footprint, but added complexity)
- [ ] Figure out more tasks to add here
